# Computer-Vision-Python
This repository hosts a Python-based tool for analyzing and comparing voice signatures using computer vision and signal processing techniques. The project transforms audio inputs into visual representations (e.g., spectrograms) and applies deep learning or feature-matching algorithms to measure similarity between voices.
